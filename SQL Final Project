This project was completed using a data set called 'chinook' from Break Into Tech which inludes the following data:

"employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
 customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
 The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
 artists table stores artists data.
 albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.
 media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
 genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
 tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
 playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship"

SQL Questions:

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

select FirstName, LastName, customerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers WHERE country <> 'United States';

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

select FirstName, LastName, customerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers WHERE country = 'Brazil';

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.invoiceid, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
from chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices ON customers.customerID = invoices.customerID;

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

select  EmployeeId, FirstName, Lastname, title
FROM employees 
WHERE title LIKE 'Sales Support Agent';

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

select DISTINCT  Billingcountry from invoices;
