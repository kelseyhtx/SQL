The "SQL murder mystery" is a SQL practice tool from knightlab.com.

The probelm is as follows:
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

1. select * from crime_scene_report 
WHERE
date = 20180115
AND type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';

date	type	description	city
20180115	murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

2. select * from person where 
name LIKE '%Annabel%'
AND address_street_name LIKE '%Franklin%';

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143

3. select * from person where 
address_street_name LIKE '%Northwester%'
order by address_number desc
LIMIT 1;

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949

4. select * from interview 
WHERE
person_id = 16371
OR person_id = 14887;

14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

5. select get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE get_fit_now_check_in.check_in_date = 20180109
AND WHERE get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id LIKE '%48z%'
AND WHERE ;
