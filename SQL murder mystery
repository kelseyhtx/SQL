The "SQL murder mystery" is a SQL practice tool from knightlab.com.

The probelm is as follows:
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

1. select * from crime_scene_report 
WHERE
date = 20180115
AND type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';

date	type	description	city
20180115	murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

2. select * from person where 
name LIKE '%Annabel%'
AND address_street_name LIKE '%Franklin%';

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143

3. select * from person where 
address_street_name LIKE '%Northwester%'
order by address_number desc
LIMIT 1;

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949

4. select * from interview 
WHERE
person_id = 16371
OR person_id = 14887;

person_id	transcript
14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

5. select get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id, get_fit_now_member.name
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
JOIN get_fit_now_member ON get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id = get_fit_now_member.id
JOIN person ON get_fit_now_member.person_id = person.id
JOIN drivers_license on person.license_id = drivers_license.id
WHERE get_fit_now_check_in.check_in_date = '20180109'
AND get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id LIKE '%48z%'
AND get_fit_now_member.membership_status = 'gold'
AND drivers_license.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

membership_id	name
48Z55	Jeremy Bowers

SOLUTION
Did you find the killer?
Jeremy Bowers'
1 INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');

SELECT value FROM solution;

value
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

6. select transcript 
FROM interview
JOIN person on person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE person.name = 'Jeremy Bowers';

transcript
I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

7. select p.name

from person p

JOIN facebook_event_checkin f on f.person_id = p.id

JOIN drivers_license d on d.id = p.license_id
